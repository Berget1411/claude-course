- **Advanced conversation patterns** (multi-turn, system prompts, temperature control)
- **Streaming and real-time responses**
- **Tool use and function calling**
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** with hybrid search
- **Structured data extraction**
- **Image and PDF processing**
- **Prompt engineering and evaluation**
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** integration
- **Agent patterns and workflows**
- **Prompt caching and optimization**
